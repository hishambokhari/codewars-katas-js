// Question 2 

// what is the difference between "==" and "==="?

// Both these signs are comparison operators

// Difference:

// "==" only compares the value not the type

// "===" compares value and type

// if('1' == 1){

// }

// question 3

// What is the difference between keyword let and const?

// Both can be used to define variables

// with const after the first assignment of value you cannot reassign it 
// let allows you to assign values as many times 

// let l = 1;
// l=2;
// console.log(l); reassigns the l value to 2 

// const c = 1;
// c=2;
// console.log(c); throws an error because cannot reassign
